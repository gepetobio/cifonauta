== Vagrant support ==

For this, you need to instal Virtual Box on [https://www.virtualbox.org/]

On the root of the project, run `vagrant up` and it will install the Virtual Machine (VM). This may take some time... once it's completed, run `vagrant ssh` and you'll ssh the VM.

Once on the VM, `cd /var/www` and you'll be in the root of the project. Then you should start running the server (this is the bit that needs to be complete).
